Simple beginner project I built while practicing Python basics (file I/O, lists, loops, CLI).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Python CLI flash card game:

User runs program. PythonCards.py will generate a .txt file (pyFlash.txt) which is populated with "Q: " "A: " prompts. 

Insert your question under "Q" and correct answer under "A". 

Save your .txt file, run PythonCards.

Through the CLI, you are prompted to answer your questions. After you answer, the correct answer is shown.

You can then replay that deck, or you can delete it, and PythonCards will generate a blank document the next time you run it.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE: This version of PyFlash was developed and tested on Windows 11.
It should work on other operating systems (Linux/macOS), but behavior has not yet been tested outside Windows.

FUTURE UPDATES:

- Allow user to save questions to different decks, pythonCards generates a new blank deck for you when requested, or you can load old ones.

- GUI for desktop version application. 

- Grading

- Pre-built decks

- Points reward system

- Wrong answer review (run only questions you missed)

- Shuffle toggle

- Configurable number of questions

- Media support

- Card types (multiple choice, true/false, typed answer(s))

- Progress/statistics tracking

- Optional JSON deck format for easier editing

- Deck editor inside the app
